# DDFT for Biomolecular Condensates

This repository contains a research implementation of an adiabatic dynamical
density functional theory (DDFT) framework for the nonequilibrium evolution of
biomolecular condensates. The code combines a sequence-dependent
random-phase-approximation/Flory–Huggins (RPA+FH) bulk free energy with a
square-gradient interfacial term and evolves the protein density field using
the finite-volume package [FiPy](https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/).

The current release was developed primarily for two-dimensional, single-protein
calculations of droplet relaxation, interface evolution, and coalescence. It is
research code rather than a general-purpose DDFT package.

## Model and current scope

In reduced units, the implemented dynamics have the form

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}
= \nabla \cdot \left[\phi\nabla\mu\right],
\qquad
\mu = \mu_{\mathrm{RPA+FH}}(\phi)-\kappa\nabla^2\phi,
$$

where \(\phi\) is the protein monomer density (volume fraction in the default
mapping), \(\mu_{\mathrm{RPA+FH}}\) is the sequence-dependent bulk chemical
potential, and \(\kappa\) is the square-gradient or influence parameter. The
main driver uses an adaptive time step and supports zero-flux and Robin-type
boundary conditions.

The released workflow should currently be used with `no_comps,1`. The example
input uses zero added salt. Experimental two-component routines are included,
but they are not yet connected to a complete two-field DDFT driver. Hydrodynamic
interactions and viscous dissipation are not included. Mapping the reduced time
to physical units therefore requires a diffusivity/mobility choice, and absolute
times depend on that mapping.

## Requirements

The code requires Python 3.10 or newer and the following packages:

- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- FiPy
- PETSc and `petsc4py`
- `mpi4py`
- MoviePy 1.x (`moviepy.editor` is imported by the current code)

One possible Conda installation is:

```bash
conda create -n ddft -c conda-forge python=3.10 numpy scipy matplotlib \
    fipy petsc4py mpi4py "moviepy<2"
conda activate ddft
```

Movie creation additionally requires FFmpeg and `gifsicle`. On an HPC system,
the MPI, PETSc, and Python modules should be adjusted to match the local
software stack.

## Quick start

From the repository root:

```bash
mkdir -p Results/example/states

python scripts/DDFT/RPA_ddft.py \
    --i scripts/DDFT/input_params.txt \
    --o Results/example/ \
    --s Results/example/
```

The trailing `/` on the output and state paths is required by the current path
handling. For cluster runs, the files in `scripts/bash/` provide SLURM examples,
but their module names, absolute paths, resources, and account-specific settings
must be edited before use.

If `state.pickle` is present in the state directory and its grid, salt,
temperature, and \(\kappa\) settings match the new input, the calculation resumes
from that checkpoint. Use a new output/state directory to begin an independent
run.

## Input parameters

Simulation settings are read from a comma-separated text file such as
`scripts/DDFT/input_params.txt`. The most important entries are:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `dimension`, `nx`, `ny`, `dx` | Dimensionality and finite-volume grid; the supplied example is 2D. |
| `dt`, `dt_min`, `dt_max` | Initial, minimum, and maximum adaptive time steps. |
| `duration`, `total_steps`, `tolerance` | Stopping limits and nonlinear-sweep tolerance. |
| `seq_name1` | Protein sequence name defined in `Protein_RPA/seq_list.py`. |
| `phis` | Salt volume fraction; the supplied example uses zero. |
| `temperature_inverse` | Reduced inverse-temperature/electrostatic-coupling variable \(u\). |
| `enthalpy1`, `entropy1` | Parameters defining the short-range FH contribution, \(\chi(u)=e_hu+e_s\) in the default mapping. |
| `kappa` | Square-gradient/influence parameter controlling the interfacial penalty. |
| `idense`, `idil` | Initial dense- and dilute-phase protein densities. |
| `initial_density` | Name of an initial-condition method in `density_class.py`; the default creates two nearby circular droplets. |
| `boundary_type` | Boundary condition; the example uses `zero_flux`. |
| `phi_boundary`, `h_mul` | Reservoir density and transfer coefficient used by Robin-type boundaries. |
| `n_capture`, `state_save` | Frequencies for image generation and checkpoint storage. |

To add a protein, define its one-letter amino-acid sequence in the `polymers`
class in `scripts/DDFT/Protein_RPA/seq_list.py` and use that attribute name for
`seq_name1`. The current DDFT driver uses fixed integer charges for charged
residues; pH-dependent charging routines exist in `Protein_RPA` but are not
currently activated by the main input file.

## Output

A 2D calculation produces:

- `P_step_*.png`: two-dimensional protein-density fields;
- `D_step_*.png`: density profiles through the center of the domain;
- `M_step_*.png`: chemical-potential fields;
- `state.pickle`: the latest restart state; and
- `states/state-*.pickle`: saved checkpoint history.

`scripts/DDFT/movie.py` can convert the PNG series to GIF and MP4 files.
